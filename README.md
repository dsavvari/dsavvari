### 🔭 I’m currently working on

- 🔌 [**STM32-recipes**](https://github.com/dsavvari/stm32-recipes)  
  A curated collection of **bare-metal** and **CMSIS/HAL** STM32L4 examples for the B-L4S5I-IOT01A board.  
  - Includes minimal, self-contained projects for GPIO, PWM, and more.
  - Each example is in its own folder with a standalone `CMakeLists.txt` for easy building and deployment.
  - Focuses on direct register access and clean, well-documented code for learning and rapid prototyping.
